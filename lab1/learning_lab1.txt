*** how to round ***
double value = (int) (var * 100 + 0.5);
return value / 100;
    integer typecast - always rounds down to floor

or round through %.2f which has regular rounding



*** compiling ***
need both main file and file w/ functions to run, must compile together
    gcc file1.c file2.c // will auto output to a.exe
    can run ./a.exe

    or

    gcc file1.c file2.c -o outputfile.exe
    ./outputfile
can only have one int main(){} function in all files


*** misc ***
changing directories
cd filename moves down a directory
cd..  moves up a level
