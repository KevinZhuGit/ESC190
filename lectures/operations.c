/*
Arthrimitic Logic Unit (ALU)
    - uses logic gates: and, or, xor, not


Do addition in binary:

ex: 0b1001000111            ->0b representats a binary type(?)
    0b0111010011

learn how binary addition works
- changes are 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

doing through logic gates:
keep track of each bit and the carry
remainder = (a&b&c)|(a^b^c)
carry = (a&b)|(a&c)|(c&b)
