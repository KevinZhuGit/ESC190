/*
HASHTABLES

Mapping between keys and buckets
    hash function gives the mapping process
        - want to be uniform if possible

Load factor (a) - how many buckets are filled / total amount of buckets
    ideally want a < 1 -> has a bucket for every key

Collision management
    - chaining in each bucket
    - linear probing
    - quardratic probing
